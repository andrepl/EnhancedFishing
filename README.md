EnhancedFishing brings many improvements to the vanilla minecraft fishing mechanics.  First of all, it gives you complete control over a players chance of getting a bite while fishing.  You can modify the overall odds, and create custom permission nodes that will grant your users improved odds.  It also adds a touch of realism in that other nearby fishermen or mobs will have an effect on your odds.  

In addition to this, EnhancedFishing adds REAL support for several new enchantments on fishing rods.  

* Efficiency: Improve the chance of getting a bite
* Looting: Find sunken treasure (Configurable loot table included)
* Fortune: Catch more than 1 fish at a time
* Fire Aspect: Catch cooked Fish
* Thorns: Fish hooks deal damage to mobs they hit.

All of these effects can be disabled globally through the admin, or by using negated permissions of the form: ##-enhancedfishing.enchantment.looting##
